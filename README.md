# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We are using VBA to help Steve analyze stock performance by their annual return in 2018, which allows his parents to make better decision on stock investment.


## Results
As we see from the results table below, it's obvious that most stocks didn't perform well in 2018 including DQ which interested Steve's parents. However, we do see there are two good stocks showed positive return, ENPH and RUN. Therefore, stock ENPH and RUN look like better options than DQ, and diversifing porfolio should be considered.

## Summary
- Adventage of Code Refactoring: Codes are fresher and cleaner after refactoring, which allows users and developers to read easily.
- Disadvantage of Code Refactoring: Time consuming
- Pros of refactoring original VBA scripts: It's easier to read and better for future use. Also the logic is clearer by reduing unnecessary codes and better select and name varibles.
- Cons of refactoring original VBA scripts: It caused typo or bugs during the process, which cost time to debug.
